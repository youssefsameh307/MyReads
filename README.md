## Starters

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

* the server should work and the website should open 



## the actual website
the website consists of 2 pages:
    1. the main page containging the shelves 
    2. the search page displaying a query result
both pages contain a button leading to the other 


## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
